W1: Predicting Sentiment from Product Reviews (Text Mining)
- Perform data cleaning (texting cleaning)
- Use sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer to convert a collection of texts to a matrix of token counts
- Use sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression to train logistic regression models to predict the sentiment of product reviews
- Inspect the coefficients of the logistic regression models and interpret their meanings
- Make predictions (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review
- Compare multiple logistic regression models by computing their accurancy
