W1: Predicting Sentiment from Product Reviews (Text Mining)
- Perform data cleaning (texting cleaning)
- Use sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer to convert a collection of texts to a matrix of token counts
- Use sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression to train logistic regression models to predict the sentiment of product reviews
- Inspect the coefficients of the logistic regression models and interpret their meanings
- Make predictions (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review
- Compare multiple logistic regression models by computing their accuracy

W2: Implementing Logistic Regression
- Implement the link function for logistic regression
- Write a function to compute the derivative of the log likelihood function with respect to a single weight
- Implement gradient ascent
- Make predictions of sentiment given a set of weights
- Compute classification accuracy for the logistic regression model
